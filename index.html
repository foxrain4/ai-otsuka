<h1>🌸 Ai Otsuka – Melancholy & Magic</h1>

<div class="section">
  <p><span class="icon">🎹</span><strong>Ai Otsuka</strong> is a name tied to warmth and wistfulness. Debuting in the early 2000s, her music carries the sparkle of youth and the ache of longing, in equal measure.</p>
</div>

<h2>🌧️ Beginnings in Rain</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Her first major hit, <em>Sakuranbo</em>, burst with sugary charm—bright melodies, cheeky lyrics. But beneath the pop exterior, Ai has always had an undercurrent of vulnerability.</p>
  <p>Even her playful songs hold a tinge of sadness, like cherry blossoms falling too soon.</p>
</div>

<h2>🕊️ Duality in Her Sound</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of her gifts is contrast. Albums like <em>LOVE JAM</em> and <em>LOVE COOK</em> slide between the innocent and the existential, the colorful and the grayscale.</p>
  <p class="quote">"Love isn’t always sweet—it’s strange, it’s wild, it’s painful."</p>
</div>

<h2>🌌 Beyond the Idol</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>She stepped away from the mainstream image of a J-pop idol, evolving into a composer, actress, and voice for emotional depth. Her later works, including acoustic tracks and her <em>LOVE IS BORN</em> live series, reveal a quieter, wiser voice.</p>
</div>

<h2>🫧 Legacy of Light</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Today, Ai Otsuka stands not just as a nostalgic icon, but a reminder: vulnerability is strength, and innocence can carry wisdom. Her songs are the kind you remember in quiet moments—gentle echoes of a younger, braver heart.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p><span class="icon">🌙</span>If you're listening late at night, start with <em>Planetarium</em> or <em>Kingyo Hanabi</em>. Let her voice carry you.</p>
